    "This app simulates a coffee maker using the principles of a finite state machine (FSM).\n",
    "The coffee maker goes through various states: Idle, HeatingWater, Brewing, and Dispensing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features:\n",
    "1. Welcome the customer.\n",
    "2. Show a list of coffee options with prices.\n",
    "3. Allow the user to select a coffee option.\n",
    "4. Ask the user for any add-ons like sugar or cream, which have additional charges.\n",
    "5. Confirm the user's selection.\n",
    "6. Collect the money entered by the user and validate it against the total price.\n",
    "7. Start the brewing process after validating the payment.\n",
    "8. Dispense the coffee once brewing is complete.\n",
    "9. Ask the user if they want to order anything else after dispensing the coffee.\n",
    "10. Restart the process if the user wants to place another order.\n",
    "\n",
    "States:\n",
    "- Idle: Initial state, waiting for user input.\n",
    "- HeatingWater: State when the coffee maker is heating water.\n",
    "- Brewing: State when the coffee maker is brewing coffee.\n",
    "- Dispensing: State when the coffee maker is dispensing the brewed coffee.\n",

    "Transitions:\n",
    "- start_brew: Transition from Idle to HeatingWater.\n",
